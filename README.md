Gnat
=====

Gnat is an open-source radiation transport and nuclide activation / depletion solver developed by the Centre for
Small Modular Reactors at Ontario Tech University (OTU), which is built on top of the MOOSE finite element
framework. Gnat has been designed to simulate neutron activation in gases and aerosols, acting as
the source-term solver for the next-generation health physics and environmental impact code Caribou.

## Installation

Installation instructions can be found
[here](https://otu-centre-for-smrs.github.io/gnat_docs/installation/index.html).

## Documentation

Documentation of Gnat is still a heavy work in progress. User's can visit the documentation webstite [here](https://otu-centre-for-smrs.github.io/gnat_docs/).

New users of Gnat and/or Caribou are encourages to visit the
[MOOSE website](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/) and the
[MOOSE tutorials](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/index.html)
to learn about how MOOSE-based applications are structured and to get a feel for
using and developing a MOOSE-based application.
